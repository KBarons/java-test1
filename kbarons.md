5. N
6. Y

1. Very good!
2. Very good!
3. Good! Only minor mistake: the Fibonacci sequence starts with `1, 1`, not `0, 1`
6. Not quite there. First of all, I would not call the hacker 'Dear user', but more importantly, the application fails on an input like, say, `)()(`

### Notes:
- good use of git!
- stick to using meaningful variable names
